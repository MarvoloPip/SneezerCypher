# SneezerCypher

Welcome to the SneezerCypher! 

This is a variation of the Caesar Cipher using ASCII where you will be able to shift characters
in the forward directionFor example, the character ‘A’ has an ASCII value of 65. Using a shift of +3, it will become the character with the ASCII value of 65+3=68 which is ‘D’

There isn’t a limit of how big your shift value can be since if it exceeds the range of symbols, it will just loop around back to the first symbol it recognizes. I.e if the range of symbols is “abc”, a shift of +2 and +5 on “a” will each result in “c”

You also have an option to decipher encrypted texts as long as you know the shift key. If you
are unsure, you will need to input a value(v) and it output results of using shift keys from 0 - v

Hope you enjoy!
